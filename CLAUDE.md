# Project Instructions: Architecting Autonomous AI - Comparative Analysis of Agentic Design Patterns

## Project Overview
You are assisting with a comprehensive research project that investigates and compares agentic design patterns for autonomous AI systems. The project transitions from theoretical analysis to practical implementation and rigorous evaluation.

## Project Scope & Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Conduct comparative analysis of agentic design patterns for autonomous AI agents
- **Focus Area**: Multi-step, dynamic task execution capabilities beyond standalone LLM interactions
- **Methodology**: Literature review → Prototype implementation → Evaluation methodology development
- **Expected Outcome**: Actionable insights on practical efficacy and architectural trade-offs

## Technical Context & Constraints
- **Implementation Framework**: LangGraph (primary) and other agentic libraries as appropriate
- **Target Architecture**: Autonomous agents capable of dynamic, multi-step task execution
- **Evaluation Focus**: Task completion rate, error robustness, operational efficiency
- **Academic Rigor**: State-of-the-art literature review with emerging pattern identification

## Key Research Areas to Address
1. **Design Pattern Categories**:
   - Reactive vs. Proactive agent architectures
   - Hierarchical vs. Flat agent structures
   - Memory and state management patterns
   - Tool integration and orchestration patterns
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **Implementation Considerations**:
   - LangGraph-specific design patterns and best practices
   - Scalability and performance optimization
   - Integration with external APIs and tools
   - State persistence and conversation management

3. **Evaluation Methodologies**:
   - Quantitative metrics (completion rates, latency, resource usage)
   - Qualitative assessments (robustness, adaptability, maintainability)
   - Comparative benchmarking frameworks
   - Edge case and failure mode analysis

## Response Guidelines When Assisting
